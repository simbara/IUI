abstract = {Pervasive sensors in the home have a variety of applications including energy minimization, activity monitoring for elders, and tutors for household tasks such as cooking. Many of the common sensors today are binary, e.g. IR motion sensors, door close sensors, and floor pressure pads. Predicting user behavior is one of the key enablers for applications. While we consider smart home data here, the general problem is one of predicting discrete human actions. Drawing on Activity Theory, the lan- guage as action principle, and speech understanding research, we argue that smoothed n-grams are very appropriate for this task.We built such a model and applied it to data gathered from 3 smart home installa- tions. The data showed a classic Zipf or power-law distribution, similar to speech and language. We found that the predictive accuracy of the n-gram model ranges from 51\% to 39\%, which is significantly above the baseline for the deployments of 16, 76 and 70 sensors. While we cannot directly compare this result with other work (lack of shared data), by examination of high entropy zones in the datasets (e.g. the kitchen tri- angle) we argue that accuracies around 50\% are best possible for this task.},

abstract = {One of the problems with notification appliances is that they can be distracting when providing information not of immediate interest to the user. In this paper, we present AuraOrb, an ambient notification appliance that deploys progressive turn taking techniques to minimize notification disruptions. AuraOrb uses eye contact sensing to detect user interest in an initially ambient light notification. Once detected, it displays a text message with a notification heading visible from 360 degrees. Touching the orb causes the associated message to be displayed on the user's computer screen.We performed an initial evaluation of AuraOrb's functionality using a set of heuristics tailored to ambient displays. Results of our evaluation suggest that progressive turn taking techniques allowed AuraOrb users to access notification headings with minimal impact on their focus task.},

abstract = {The “cocktail party effect”—the ability to focus one’s listening attention on a single talker among a cacophony of conversations and background noise—has been recognized for some time. This specialized listening ability may be because of characteristics of the human speech production system, the auditory system, or high-level perceptual and language processing. This paper investigates the literature on what is known about the effect, from the original technical descriptions through current research in the areas of auditory streams and spatial display systems. The underlying goal of the paper is to analyze the components of this effect to uncover relevant attributes of the speech production and perception chain that could be exploited in future speech communication systems. The motivation is to build a system that can simultaneously present multiple streams of speech information such that a user can focus on one stream, yet easily shift attention to the others. A set of speech applications and user interfaces that take advantage of the ability to computationally simulate the cocktail party effect are also considered.},

abstract = {For the majority of us, inter-personal communication is an essential part of our daily lives. Instant Messaging, or IM, has been growing in popularity for personal and work-related communication. The low cost of sending a message, combined with the limited awareness provided by current IM systems result in messages often arriving at inconvenient or disruptive times. In a step towards solving this problem, we created statistical models that successfully predict responsiveness to incoming instant messages -- simply put: whether the receiver is likely to respond to a message within a certain time period. These models were constructed using a large corpus of real IM interaction collected from 16 participants, including over 90,000 messages. The models we present can predict, with accuracy as high as 90.1\%, whether a message sent to begin a new session of communication would get a response within 30 seconds, 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes. This type of prediction can be used, for example, to drive online-status indicators, or in services aimed at finding potential communicators.},

abstract = {Driver distractions can be categorized into 3 major parts:-visual, cognitive and manual. Visual and manual distraction on a driver can be physically detected. However, assessing cognitive distraction is difficult since it is more of an \&amp;\#x201C;internal\&amp;\#x201D; distraction rather than any easily measured \&amp;\#x201C;external\&amp;\#x201D; distraction. There are several methods available that can be used to detect cognitive driver distraction. Physiological measurements, performance measures (primary and secondary tasks) and rating scales are some of the well-known measures to detect cognitive distraction. This study focused on physiological measurements, specifically on a driver's eye and mouth movements. Six different participants were involved in our experiment. The duration of the experiment was 8 minutes and 49 seconds for each participant. Eye and mouth movements were obtained using the FaceLab Seeing Machine cameras and their magnitude of the r-values were found more than 60\% thus proving that they are strongly correlated to each other.},

abstract = {We present automated, real-time models built with machine learning algorithms which use videotapes of subjects' faces in conjunction with physiological measurements to predict rated emotion (trained coders' second-by-second assessments of sadness or amusement). Input consisted of videotapes of 41 subjects watching emotionally evocative films along with measures of their cardiovascular activity, somatic activity, and electrodermal responding. We built algorithms based on extracted points from the subjects' faces as well as their physiological responses. Strengths of the current approach are (1) we are assessing real behavior of subjects watching emotional videos instead of actors making facial poses, (2) the training data allow us to predict both emotion type (amusement versus sadness) as well as the intensity level of each emotion, (3) we provide a direct comparison between person-specific, gender-specific, and general models. Results demonstrated good fits for the models overall, with better performance for emotion categories than for emotion intensity, for amusement ratings than sadness ratings, for a full model using both physiological measures and facial tracking than for either cue alone, and for person-specific models than for gender-specific or general models. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {As users continue offloading more control and responsibility to the computer, coordinating the asynchronous interactions between the user and computer is becoming increasingly important. Without proper coordination, an application attempting to gain the user's attention risks interrupting the user in the midst of performing another task. To justify why an application should avoid interrupting the user whenever possible, we designed an experiment measuring the disruptive effect of an interruption on a user's task performance. The experiment utilized six Web-based task categories and two categories of interruption tasks. The results of the experiment demonstrate that: (i) a user performs slower on an interrupted task than a non-interrupted task, (ii) the disruptive effect of an interruption differs as a function of the task category, and (iii) different interruption tasks cause similar disruptive effects on task performance. These results empirically validate the need to better coordinate user interactions among applications that are competing for the user's attention},

Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.},

abstract = {HE frequencies of communication be- tween members participating in small face-to-face groups show certain striking regularities which have not pre- viously been described. The observations re- ported here were made over a period of several years. Various sorts of small prob- lem-solving groups were observed with a variety of primary hypotheses in mind. The method of analyzing the data reported here had not been developed at that time. The possibility of using the data for the present investigation grew from the fact that a uni- form method of observation was used throughout. A number of the groups were composed of students brought together in an experi- mental room to solve various contrived problems. Others were non-student commit- tees or work groups in their natural settings. Two therapy groups through a series of sessions were included. A large number of groups were case-discussion meetings of diagnostic councils operating in a research- clinic setting. It is probably accurate to say that most of the groups could be called decision-making, or problem-solving, or dis- cussion groups. The groups ranged in size from three to ten persons. The conversation generally pro- ceeded so that one person talked at a time, and all members in the particular group were attending the same conversation. In this sense, these groups might be said to have a "single focus," that is, they did not involve a number of conversations proceed- ing at the same time, as one finds at a cocktail party or in a hotel lobby. The single focus is probably a limiting condition of fundamental importance in the general- izations reported here. Larger groups or other types of groups with multiple foci are probably somewhat different with regard to certain aspects of channel frequency.},

abstract = {This study investigates how a personality trait and expertise affect virtual teams interaction, and how that interaction leads to different levels of performance (e.g., solution quality, solution acceptance, cohesion). Teams have been shown to exhibit constructive, aggressive/defensive, or passive/defensive interaction styles that affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. These styles reflect an aggregation of the behaviors exhibited by individual team members, which are rooted in their individual personalities. The effects of interaction style on team performance have been well established in face-to-face and virtual teams. Generally, constructive interaction styles produce positive outcomes whereas passive/defensive styles beget negative ones. Aggressive/defensive teams produce solutions that are correlated with the expertise of those that have wrested control of the group -but there is often little support for those solutions. The current work explores how different constellations of extraversion and expertise manifest themselves into group interaction styles and, ultimately, outcomes. The study involves 248 professional managers from executive MBA and professional development programs in 63 virtual teams that performed an intellective task. Results show that expertise and extraversion to be curvilinearly related to group interactions and performance, and high levels of extraversion and higher variations in extraversion between team members lead to less constructive and more passive/defensive interaction styles within teams. Results show that although expertise is the best predictor of task performance, it is primarily group interaction styles that predict contextual outcomes (e.g., solution acceptance, cohesion, effectiveness) in virtual teams.},

abstract = {People are often unaware of the reasons and causes of their own behavior. In fact, recent experimental evidence points to a deep and fundamental dissociation between conscious awareness and the mental processes responsible for one's behavior; many of the wellsprings of behavior appear to be opaque to conscious access. That research has proceeded somewhat independently in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology, but all three lines of research have reached the same general conclusions despite the quite different methodologies and guiding theoretical perspectives employed. This consensus has emerged in part because of the remarkable resemblance between the behavior of patients with some forms of frontal lobe damage and (normal) participants in contemporary priming studies in social psychology. In both cases, the individual's behavior is being "controlled" by external stimuli, not by his or her own consciously accessible intentions or acts of will. Both sets of evidence demonstrate that action tendencies can be activated and triggered independently and in the absence of the individual's conscious choice or awareness of those causal triggers. In this chapter, I compare and contrast lines of research relevant to the nonconscious control of individual social behavior-that is, behavior induced to occur by environmental factors and not by the individual's conscious awareness and intentions. These lines of relevant research come from social psychology as well as cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and the study of hypnosis. Yet they converge on the same story: that, at best, we have imperfect conscious access to the basic brain/mind processes that help govern our own behavior, broadly defined (i.e., from the motoric to the social and motivational levels). The priming and the patient studies do complement and support each other in demonstrating the same two principles: that an individual's behavior can be directly caused by the current environment, without the necessity of an act of conscious choice or will; and that this behavior can and will unfold without the person being aware of its external determinant.},

In a recent issue of this journal (Volume 7, No. 1–2, 2000), researchers from many disciplines debated the evolutionary origins of morality. Essentially, they were interested in discuss- ing animal roots on which human morality might be built, even if it is not identical to animal morality. Charles Darwin’s (1859; 1872/1998) ideas about evolutionary continuity, namely that behavioural, cognitive, and emotional variations among different species are differences in degree rather than difference in kind,areoften invoked in such exercises.},

abstract = {This essay considers the problem of defining the context that context-aware systems should pay attention to from a human perspective. In particular, we argue that there are human aspects of context that cannot be sensed or even inferred by technological means, so context-aware systems cannot be designed simply to act on our behalf. Rather, they will have to be able to defer to users in an efficient and nonobtrusive fashion. Our point is particularly relevant for systems that are constructed such that applications are architecturally isolated from the sensing and inferencing that governs their behavior. We propose a design framework that is intended to guide thinking about accommodating human aspects of context. This framework presents four design principles that support intelligibility of system behavior and accountability of human users and a number of human-salient details of context that must be accounted for in context-aware system design.},

abstract = {Using a simulated driving station, 36 participants applied the brake as quickly as possible following the activation of a red light under each of six conditions including (1) the control (braking only), (2) 72 dBA music stimulus, (3) 86 dBA music stimulus, (4) cell phone conversation, (5) cell phone conversation and 72dBA music, and (6) cell phone conversation and 86dBA music. Participants were distracted by the cell phone conversation, as demonstrated by slower response time and reaction time (RT). The addition of the music stimulus, even at 86 dBA, did not exacerbate the deficits. Braking movement time was faster, and peak braking force greater when the cell phone conversation was present than when it was absent. Participants appear to have anticipated impaired RT and adapted unconsciously by executing a more rapid movement to the brake pedal. Also, participants appear to have compensated for slower RT by applying greater braking force. The adaptive behavior observed in the experiment is discussed in the context of unconscious goal pursuit and neuromotor noise theory.},

abstract = {Text messaging while driving is considered dangerous and known to produce injuries and fatalities. However, the effects of text messaging on driving performance have not been synthesized or summarily estimated. All available experimental studies that measured the effects of text messaging on driving were identified through database searches using variants of "driving" and "texting" without restriction on year of publication through March 2014. Of the 1476 abstracts reviewed, 82 met general inclusion criteria. Of these, 28 studies were found to sufficiently compare reading or typing text messages while driving with a control or baseline condition. Independent variables (text-messaging tasks) were coded as typing, reading, or a combination of both. Dependent variables included eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Statistics were extracted from studies to compute effect sizes (rc). A total sample of 977 participants from 28 experimental studies yielded 234 effect size estimates of the relationships among independent and dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages while driving adversely affected eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Typing text messages alone produced similar decrements as typing and reading, whereas reading alone had smaller decrements over fewer dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages affects drivers' capability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, control a vehicle within a lane and maintain speed and headway. This meta-analysis provides convergent evidence that texting compromises the safety of the driver, passengers and other road users. Combined efforts, including legislation, enforcement, blocking technologies, parent modeling, social media, social norms and education, will be required to prevent continued deaths and injuries from texting and driving. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The empirical basis for legislation to limit cell phones while driving is addressed. A comprehensive meta-analysis of the effects of cell phones on driving performance was performed. A total of 33 studies collected through 2007 that met inclusion criteria yielded 94 effect size estimates, with a total sample size of approximately 2000 participants. The dependent variables of reaction time, lateral vehicle control, headway and speed and the moderating variables of research setting (i.e., laboratory, simulator, on-road), conversation target (passenger, cell phone) and conversation type (cognitive task, naturalistic) were coded. Reaction time (RT) to events and stimuli while talking produced the largest performance decrements. Handheld and hands-free phones produced similar RT decrements. Overall, a mean increase in RT of .25 s was found to all types of phone-related tasks. Observed performance decrements probably underestimate the true behavior of drivers with mobile phones in their own vehicles. In addition, drivers using either phone type do not appreciably compensate by giving greater headway or reducing speed. Tests for moderator effects on RT and speed found no statistically significant effect size differences across laboratory, driving simulation and on-road research settings. The implications of the results for legislation and future research are considered. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present an experimental study on the effectiveness of five modality variants (speech, text-only, icon-only, two combinations of text and icons) for presenting local danger warnings for drivers. Hereby, we focus on sudden appearing road obstacles within a maximum up-to-date scenario as it is envisaged in Car2Car communication research. The effectiveness is measured by the minimum time necessary for fully interpreting the content. Results show that text-only requires the most time while icon only is perceived the fastest. The two combined versions lie in between. The minimum length for speech is determined by the duration of the utterance, which is longer than perception time of text-only in this case. However, speech could be decoded reliably by nearly all subjects. Results indicate further that a blinking visual cue provided through the periphery visual channel is able to enhance the saliency of visual modalities. Subjective judgements by the subjects furthermore suggest a combined use of visual and auditory modalities.},

abstract = {As in-vehicle information systems are increasingly able to obtain and deliver information, driver distraction becomes a larger concern. In this paper we propose that informative interruption cues (IIC) can be an effective means to support drivers’ attention management. As a first step, we investigated the design and presentation modality of IIC that conveyed not only the arrival but also the priority level of a message. Both sound and vibration cues were created for four different priority levels and tested in 5 task conditions that simulated possible perceptional and cognitive load in real driving situations. Results showed that the cues were quickly learned, reliably detected, and quickly and accurately identified. Vibration was found to be a promising alternative for sound to deliver IIC, as vibration cues were identified more accurately and interfered less with driving. Sound cues also had advantages in terms of shorter response time and more (reported) physical comfort.},

@misc{Clancey1992,
abstract = {Expert systems can be viewed as programs that construct a model of some system in the world so that it can be assembled, repaired, controlled, etc. In contrast with most conventional computer programs, these models represent processes and structures by relational net works. Control knowledge for constructing such a model can be described as operators that construct a graph linking processes and structures causally, temporally, spatially, by subtype, etc. From this perspective, we find that the terminology of blackboard expert systems is not specific to a particular set of programs, but is rather a valuable perspective for understanding what every expert system is doing. This paper reviews different ways of describing expert system reasoning, emphasizing the use of simple logic, set, and graph notations for making dimensional analyses of modeling languages and inference methods. The practical question is, how can we systematically develop knowledge acquisition tools that capture general knowledge about types of domains and modeling methods? Examples of modeling operators from ABEL, CADUCEUS, NEOMYCIN, HASP, and ACCORD demonstrate how diverse expert system approaches can be explained and integrated by the model construction perspective. Reworked examples from TEIRESIAS, XPLAIN, and KNACK illustrate how to write metarules without using domain-specific terms, thus making explicit their model construction nature. Generalizing from these observations, we combine the system-model and operator viewpoints to describe the representation of processes in AI programs in terms of three nested levels of domain, inference, and communication modeling. This synthesis reveals how the use of relational networks in computer programs has evolved from programmer descriptions of computational processes (such as flowcharts and dataflow diagrams) to network representations that are constructed and manipulated by the programs themselves.},

abstract = {Representations have been viewed as the essential concern of cognitive science, yet few studies have examined how people create, perceive, and attribute meaning to new representational forms. How does the learner relate instructions he doesn't yet understand to features on the computer screen he can't yet parse into objects and relations? Linguistic schema models assume that the world comes pre-represented, already parameterized into objective features; reasoning operates on a stream of "perceptually obvious" symbols. In such an exclusively linguistic cognitive model, inference and comprehension rests on nothing but more words--definitions, causal relationships, classifications. Although it is well-known that such models are "ungrounded," that the symbols have no meaning to the program itself, little attempt has been made to find out how people create symbolic forms. What are the non-linguistic processes that control attention, affect reconceptualization, and correlate disparate ways of seeing? I present an example of human learning that falls outside linguistic schema theories, illustrating representation creation as perceptual interaction at both interpersonal and gestural-material levels. I focus on sequences of activity in which students' interpretation of what constitutes a representational language (and what it means) changes as they construct models of what they are seeing and doing. This social-perceptual analysis complements linguistic schema theories of novice-expert differences with more detailed learning mechanisms, emphasizing especially the nature of perception. This perspective leads to new experimentation and ways of observing and understanding student interaction with today's instructional programs.},

By one theory, the more the literal meaning of a request implies personal benefits for the listener, within reason, the more polite is the request. This prediction was confirmed in Experiment 1. Responses to indirect requests also vary in politeness. For Can you tell me where Jordan Hall is?, the response Yes, I can it's up the street is more polite than It's up the street. By an extension of that theory, the more attentive the responder is to all of the requester's meaning, the more polite is the response. This prediction was confirmed in Experiments 2, 3 and 4. From this evidence, we argued that people ordinarily compute both the literal and the indirect meanings of indirect requests. They must if they are to recognize when the speaker is and isn't being polite, and if they are to respond politely, impolitely, or even neutrally.},

abstract = {ObjectiveThe objective of this work was to understand the relationship between eye movements and cognitive workload in maintaining lane position while driving. BackgroundRecent findings in driving research have found that, paradoxically, increases in cognitive workload decrease lateral position variability. If people drive where they look and drivers look more centrally with increased cognitive workload, then one could explain the decreases in lateral position variability as a result of changes in lateral eye movements. In contrast, it is also possible that cognitive workload brings about these patterns regardless of changes in eye movements. MethodWe conducted three experiments involving a fixed-base driving simulator to independently manipulate eye movements and cognitive workload. ResultsResults indicated that eye movements played a modest role in lateral position variability, whereas cognitive workload played a much more substantial role. ConclusionsIncreases in cognitive workload decrease lane position variability independently from eye movements. These findings are discussed in terms of hierarchical control theory. ApplicationsThese findings could potentially be used to identify periods of high cognitive workload during driving.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a fully automated affect-sensitive Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) called the Affective AutoTutor. AutoTutor is an ITS that helps students learn topics in Newtonian physics, computer literacy, and critical thinking via natural language dialogues that simulate the dialogue patterns observed in human–human tutoring. AutoTutor uses state-of-the-art natural language understanding mechanisms to model learners’ cognitive states and plan its dialogue moves in a manner that is sensitive to these states. While the original AutoTutor is sensitive to learners’ cognitive states, the affect-sensitive tutor is responsive to their affective states as well. This Affective tutor automatically detects learners’ boredom, confusion, and frustration by monitoring conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The sensed affective states guide the tutor’s responses in a manner that helps learners regulate their negative emotions. The tutor also synthesizes affect via the verbal content of its responses and the facial expressions and speech of an embodied pedagogical agent. An experiment comparing the affect-sensitive and nonaffective tutors indicated that the affective tutor improved learning for low-domain knowledge learners, particularly at deeper levels of comprehension.},

The results from the study indicate that the presence of such a display influences the behavior of group participants in the extremes of over and under participation.

abstract = {User participation has transformed the way news travel the globe. With the rise of the 'Web 2.0' phenomenon users have been empowered with the means of creating and distributing informational items, which we call social feeds. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook provide a variety of tools to facilitate real-time communication among people. But social sites are not limited to personal chat; they also provide an effective means for organizing large groups of people in response to catastrophic disasters. Monitoring these feeds can provide time-critical information, but can easily lead to information overload due to the large amount of data being shared.

In this paper we introduce a mobile auditory display application called AudioFeeds that allows users to maintain an overview of activities in different social feeds. AudioFeeds runs on a mobile device and enables users to get an overview of their social networks and spot peaks in activity by sonifying social feeds and creating a spatialised soundscape around the user's head. We conducted a user study looking into different aspects of activity monitoring. Results show that our application provides an effective way for monitoring overall activity levels and allows users to identify activity peaks with 86.1\% accuracy even when mobile.},

The study reported here investigated the learnability of well known (auditory icons, earcons, and speech) and more novel (spearcons, earcon-icon hybrids, and sized hybrids) sonification techniques for representing common environmental features. Spearcons, which are speech stimuli that have been greatly sped up, were found to be as learnable as speech, while earcons unsurprisingly were much more difficult to learn.

abstract = {Objectives: An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of retrospective and combined retrospective and concurrent feedback on driver performance and engagement in distracting activities. Background: A previous study conducted by the authors showed that concurrent (or real time) feedback can help drivers better modulate their distracting activities. However, research also shows that concurrent feedback can pose additional distractions due to the limited time and resources available during driving. Retrospective feedback, which is presented at the end of a trip (i.e., post-drive), can include additional information on safety critical situations during a trip and help the driver learn safe driving habits. Method: A driving simulator study was conducted with 48 participants and 3 conditions: retrospective feedback, combined feedback (both retrospective and concurrent), and no feedback (baseline case). Results: The feedback conditions (retrospective and combined) resulted in faster response to lead vehicle braking events as depicted by shorter accelerator release times. Moreover, combined feedback also resulted in longer glances to the road. Conclusions: The results suggest that both feedback types have potential to improve immediate driving performance and driver engagement in distractions. Application: Combined feedback holds the most promise for mitigating the effects of distraction from in-vehicle information systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance. BACKGROUND: In the past decade, a number of on-road, epidemiological, and simulator-based studies reported the negative impact of talking on a cell phone on driving behavior. However, the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance is still not fully understood. METHOD: Forty participants engaged in both a single task (driving) and a dual task (driving and text messaging) in a high-fidelity driving simulator. RESULTS: Analysis of driving performance revealed that participants in the dual-task condition responded more slowly to the onset of braking lights and showed impairments in forward and lateral control compared with a driving-only condition. Moreover, text-messaging drivers were involved in more crashes than drivers not engaged in text messaging. CONCLUSION: Text messaging while driving has a negative impact on simulated driving performance. This negative impact appears to exceed the impact of conversing on a cell phone while driving. APPLICATION: The results increase our understanding of driver distraction and have potential implications for public safety and device development.},

Gradually, more specialized study of Durkheim led to more contextualized understandings of his work. By the 1960s, The Rules was read in the light of Suicide (1897), then newly translated, \& interpreted as an ancestor of functionalism. The meanings imputed to key ideas, eg, the treatment of social facts as things, also shifted. It is argued that his, then newly won, status as a founding father promoted more favorable interpretation of his meanings, \& that various factors in the social structure of the discipline also contributed to this change. 104 References.

abstract = {Throughout the history of human-computer interface development, one aspect has remained constant: output from computers has been almost entirely visual. A continued and increasing reliance on visual communication has had a disadvantageous effect on users who have visual disabilities. A visual interface is of no use to a user who is completely blind; communication must use one of the other senses, and hearing is an obvious candidate. A number of human-computer interfaces have been developed and adapted into an auditory form, based on the use of synthetic speech. However, for modern interfaces that use more complex displays, synthetic speech is not sufficient. One attempt to adapt such a mouse-based interface into an auditory form, based on musical tones and synthetic speech is described. This project involved the development of a word processor, called Soundtrack, with an auditory interface. Evaluations of this application suggest that the approach is viable, but that it is difficult to use and there are significant research questions still to be addressed},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situ- ation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

We call such systems “socially translucent systems” and suggest that they have three characteristics—visbility, awareness, and accountability—which enable people to draw upon their experience and expertise to structure their interactions with one another. To motivate and focus our ideas we develop a vision of knowledge communities, conversationally based systems that support the creation, management and reuse of knowledge in a social context. We describe our experience in designing and deploying one layer of functionality for knowledge communities, embodied in a working system called “Barbie” and discuss research issues raised by a socially translucent approach to design.},

abstract = {The Hearsay-II system, developed during the DARPA-sponsored five-year speech- understanding research program, represents both a specific solution to the speech- understanding problem and a general framework for coordinating independent processes to achieve cooperative problem-solving behavior. As a computational problem, speech understanding reflects a large number of intrinsically interesting issues. Spoken sounds are achieved by a long chain of successive transformations, from intentions, through semantm and syntactic structurmg, to the eventually resulting audible acoustic waves. As a consequence, interpreting speech means effectively inverting these transformations to recover the speaker's intention from the sound. At each step in the interpretive process, ambiguity and uncertainty arise.},

abstract = {A person seeking another person’s attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible the other person currently is. Such assessments allow behavior that we consider natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. This is in sharp contrast to current computer and communication systems, which are largely unaware of the social situations surrounding their usage and the impact that their actions have on these situations. If systems could model human interruptibility, they could use this information to negotiate interruptions at appropriate times, thus improving human computer interaction. This article presents a series of studies that quantitatively demonstrate that simple sensors can support the construction of models that estimate human interruptibility as well as people do. These models can be constructed without using complex sensors, such as vision-based techniques, and therefore their use in everyday office environments is both practical and affordable. Although currently based on a demographically limited sample, our results indicate a substantial opportunity for future research to validate these results over larger groups of office workers. Our results also motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times.},

abstract = {The study of computers as persuasive technologies (called `captology') was introduced at CHI 97 as a new area of inquiry. This paper proposes definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigation of this field. A persuasive computer is an interactive technology that attempts to change attitudes or behaviors in some way. Perspective 1 describes how computers can inherit three types of intentionality: endogenous, exogenous, and autogenous. Perspective 2 presents the `Functional Triad,' which illustrates that computers can function as persuasive tools, media, and social actors. Perspective 3 presents a `levels of analysis' approach for captology, which include varying levels from individual to societal. Perspective 4 suggests a simple method for exploring the design space for persuasive computers. Perspective 5 highlights some ethical issues inherent in persuasive computing. The paper concludes by proposing seven directions for further research and design.},

abstract = {With increased automation and supervisory control, the physical content of jobs has decreased while cognitive workload has increased. The cardiovascular system responds to both physical and cognitive stresses, and their combination, by causing an increase in both heart rate (HR) and blood pressure. The increase in HR and blood pressure cause an increase in myocardial contractility, which results in an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). The rate-pressure product (RPP), given by the product of HR and systolic blood pressure, is a very reliable indirect measure of MVO2. With this in mind, an experiment was conducted on 12 able-bodied male students from the University population. Subjects were required to perform three cognitive tasks (Stroop Incongruent Color-Word Test, simulated public speaking, and calculating task) under two physical conditions (riding a Schwinn Airdyne at a constant speed of 1/3 of their estimated maximum HR, and seated at rest on the Schwinn Airdyne). HR and blood pressure were monitored throughout the testing period. Results of the analysis of the randomized block design indicated that both cognitive and physical tasks had a significant effect on RPP. Additionally, the findings from this study indicated that RPP can be used as an objective measure to separate the components of cognitive workload and cognitive stress in combined tasks. Rate-pressure product may be used as a measure of occupational workload, both cognitive and physical. It may be possible to use RPP measures to set limits on workloads and for establishing work allowance. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The appropriate use of nonspeech sounds has the potential to add a great deal to the functionality of computer interfaces. Sound is a largely unexploited medium of output, even though it plays an integral role in our everyday encounters with the world, a role that is complementary to vision. Sound should be used in computers as it is in the world, where it conveys information about the nature of sound-producing events. Such a strategy leads to auditory icons, which are everyday sounds meant to convey information about computer events by analogy with everyday events. Auditory icons are an intuitively accessible way to use sound to provide multidimensional, organized information to users. These ideas are instantiated in the SonicFinder, which is an auditory interface I developed at Apple Computer, Inc. In this interface, information is conveyed using auditory icons as well as standard graphical feedback. I discuss how events are mapped to auditory icons in the SonicFinder, and illustrate how sound is used by describing a typical interaction with this interface. Two major gains are associated with using sound in this interface: an increase in direct engagement with the model world of the computer and an added flexibility for users in getting information about that world. These advantages seem to be due to the iconic nature of the mappings used between sound and the information it is to convey. I discuss sound effects and source metaphors as methods of extending auditory icons beyond the limitations implied by literal mappings, and I speculate on future directions for such interfaces.},

abstract = {Auditory icons are everyday sounds that convey information about events in the computer or in remote environments by analogy with everyday sound-producing events. Several examples of interfaces that use auditory icons demonstrate that they can add valuable functionality to computer interfaces, particularly when they are parameterized to convey dimensional information. But because they are based on a new approach to sound and hearing that emphasizes perceptual and acoustic attributes of auditory event perception, they are difficult to create and manipulate if standard synthesis and sampling techniques are used. In order to support their creation, new synthesis algorithms are introduced which are controlled along dimensions of events rather than those of the sounds themselves. Several algorithms, developed from research on auditory event perception, are described in enough detail here to permit their implementation. They produce a variety of impact, bouncing, breaking, scraping, and machine sounds. By controlling them with attributes of relevant computer events, a wide range of parameterized auditory icons may be created.},

In this article, I explore the acoustic basis of everyday listening as a start toward understanding how sounds near the ear can indicate remote physical events.

The result is a variety of algorithms which enable the synthesis of sounds made by basic-level events such as impacts, scraping, and dripping, as well as by more complex events such as bouncing, breaking, spilling, and machinery. These algorithms may serve as instantiated hypotheses about the acoustic infor- mation for events. Analysis and synthesis work together in their development: Just as analyses of the physics and acoustics of sound-producing events may inform synthesis, so listening to the results of synthesis may inform analysis. This raises several issues concerning evaluation, specification, and the tension between formal and informal physical analyses.

abstract = {Shared work often involves fluid transitions between relatively focussed collaboration, division of labour, general awareness and serendipitous communication. This leads to a tension in the design of software systems meant to support shared work: focussed collaboration implies the need to coordinate people's views of work objects, while division of labour requires individual control over views. A similar tension exists in the office environment as well: group engagement in the workplace depends on a shared context, but individual work is facilitated by privacy and freedom of action. Auditory cues have the potential to reduce these tensions because graphics and sound can provide two independent ways to present and obtain information. I illustrate the potential of sound in collaborative systems with observations drawn from two systems: the ARKola simulation, which explores the effects of sound on collaboration within a workstation environment; and EAR, in which auditory cues are used to increase general awareness of events and encourage group engagement within the workplace itself. These examples suggest useful functions sound can play in collaborative systems.},

Led by Talcott Parsons, Gordon W. Allport, Henry A. Murray, and Clyde M. Kluckhohn, the Harvard Project was intended to establish an integrative framework for social psychology, one based on the interaction process, augmented by value content analysis. Bales sees this approach as a personal involvement that goes far beyond the classical experimental approach to the study of groups. This paperback edition now makes the book available for text use and personal libraries.Bales developed SYMLOG, which stands for systematic multiple level observation of groups. The SYMLOG Consulting Group approach was worldwide as well as interactive. It created a data bank that made possible a search for general laws of human interaction far beyond anything thus far known. In his daring search for universal features, Bales redefines the fundamental boundaries of the field, and in so doing establishes criteria for the behavior and values of leaders and followers. Bales offers a new "field theory", an appreciation of the multiple contexts in which people live.Bales does not aim to eradicate differences, but to understand them. In this sense, the values inherent in any interaction situation permit the psychologist to appreciate the sources of polarization as they actually exist: between conservative and liberal, individualistic and authoritarian, libertarian and communitarian. Bales repeatedly emphasizes that the mental processes of individuals and their social interactions take place in systematic contextswhich can be measured. Hence they permit explanation and prediction of behavior in a more exact way than in past traditions. Bales has offered a pioneering work that has the potential to move us into a new theoretical epoch},

abstract = {A significant part of the work in business settings, especially in multinational projects, is done through talking over the phone in conference calls. The differences in the setting in comparison with face-to-face meetings create a new dynamic of talk and turn taking because of the lack of body language. This article analyzes a number of the differences between these two types of meetings, using a corpus of (International) Business English, in which the multinational participants discuss an information technology research project. English is used as a lingua franca among participants from different companies and different nationalities (e.g., Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish). Features studied include self-identification, the number of turns, interruptions, overlaps, back-channeling behavior, pauses, side comments, small talk, breaks, distribution of talk, meeting structure, and length of conferences. The findings show that because of the lack of body language signals, there are differences in most of these features, for example, fewer interruptions, overlaps, and pauses in concalls than in face-to-face meetings. Small talk is restricted to the end or beginning of calls if it happens at all, side comments do not happen among the participants but may occur with people outside the conference. Back channels occur more frequently in conference calls, as they constitute the only means of communicating attention. The latter highlights the concerns for politeness to secure good working relationships in business relations.},

@article{Hancock2003,
abstract = {Forty-two licensed drivers were tested in an experiment that required them to respond to an in-vehicle phone at the same time that they were faced with making a crucial stopping decision. Using test track facilities, we also examined the influence of driver gender and driver age on these dual-task response capacities. Each driver was given task practice and then performed a first block of 24 trials, where one trial represented one circuit of the test track. Half of the trials were control conditions in which neither the stop-light was activated nor was the in-vehicle phone triggered. Four trials required only stop-light response and a further four, phone response only. The remaining four trials required the driver to complete each task simultaneously. The order of presentation of specific trials was randomized and the whole sequence was repeated in a second block giving 48 trials per driver. In-vehicle phone response also contained an embedded memory task that was evaluated at the end of each trial circuit. Results confirmed our previous observation that in the dual-task condition there was a slower response to the light change. To compensate for this slowed response, drivers subsequently brake more intensely. Most importantly, we recorded a critical 15\% increase in non-response to the stop-light in the presence of the phone distraction task which equates with increased stop-light violations on the open road. These response patterns varied by driver age and driver gender. In particular, age had a large effect on task components that required speed of response to multiple, simultaneous demands. Since driving represents a highly complex and interactive environment, it is not possible to specify a simplistic relationship between these distraction effects and outcome crash patterns. However, we can conclude that such in-vehicle technologies erode performance safety margin and distract drivers from their critical primary task of vehicle control. As such it can be anticipated that a causal relation exists to collision events. This is a crucial concern for all in-vehicle device designers and for the many safety researchers and professionals seeking to reduce the adverse impacts of vehicle collisions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this paper, we document underlying forces that constitute a third wave in HCI and suggest sys- temic consequences for the CHI community. We provi- sionally name this the ‘phenomenological matrix’. In the course of creating technologies such as ubiquitous computing, visualization, affective and educational technology, a variety of approaches are addressing is- sues that are bad fits to prior paradigms, ranging from embodiment to situated meaning to values and social issues. We demonstrate the underlying unity of these approaches, and document how they suggest the cen- trality of currently marginal criteria for design, evalua- tion, appreciation, and developmental methodology in CHI work.

to measure the autonomic nervous system activation. The signals were
digitized in real time and stored on the SmartCar's Pentium class
computer. Each drive followed a pre-specified route through fifteen
different events, from which four stress level categories were created
according to the results of the subjects self report questionnaires. In
total, 545 one minute segments were classified. A linear discriminant
function was used to rank each feature individually based on the

algorithm was used to find an optimal set of features for recognizing
patterns of driver stress. Using multiple features improved performance

abstract = { This paper presents methods for collecting and analyzing physiological data during real-world driving tasks to determine a driver's relative stress level. Electrocardiogram, electromyogram, skin conductance, and respiration were recorded continuously while drivers followed a set route through open roads in the greater Boston area. Data from 24 drives of at least 50-min duration were collected for analysis. The data were analyzed in two ways. Analysis I used features from 5-min intervals of data during the rest, highway, and city driving conditions to distinguish three levels of driver stress with an accuracy of over 97\% across multiple drivers and driving days. Analysis II compared continuous features, calculated at 1-s intervals throughout the entire drive, with a metric of observable stressors created by independent coders from videotapes. The results show that for most drivers studied, skin conductivity and heart rate metrics are most closely correlated with driver stress level. These findings indicate that physiological signals can provide a metric of driver stress in future cars capable of physiological monitoring. Such a metric could be used to help manage noncritical in-vehicle information systems and could also provide a continuous measure of how different road and traffic conditions affect drivers.},

abstract = {This paper reviews research on the 'communication game' (Higgins, 1981a) that supports two sets of conclusions. The first set of conclusions concerns communication as social action: (a) Communicators tailor their summary of target information to suit their audience's knowledge of or attitudes toward the target; that is, they achieve 'shared reality' with their audience and thereby perform a social action; (b) Communicators' different motivations to achieve 'shared reality' with their audience influences the extent to which they tailor their message to suit the audience, as evident in 'super-tuning', 'anti-tuning', and 'nontuning'; (c) When there is a delay between successive messages about a target, communicators' use their first message to construct their second message even though the two audiences have different characteristics. The second set of conclusions concerns how communication as social action creates meaning: (a) Communicators use their message summaries about a target as a direct source of information about the target even when the message distorted the original target information to suit the audience, and these message summaries in turn influence the communicators' own memory and impressions of the target; (b) As the delay since communicating about the target increases, communicators' use of their message as a source of target information persists or even increases; (c) Communicators' messages about a target to suit their audience can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on the accuracy of their memory and impressions of the target.},

abstract = {The bulk of our understanding of teams is based on traditional teams in which all members are collocated and communicate face to face. However, geographically distributed teams, whose members are not collocated and must often communicate via technology, are growing in prevalence. Studies from the field are beginning to suggest that geographically distributed teams operate differently and experience different outcomes than tra- ditional teams. For example, empirical studies suggest that distributed teams experience high levels of conflict. These empirical studies offer rich and valuable descriptions of this conflict, but they do not systematically identify the mecha- nisms by which conflict is engendered in distributed teams. In this paper, we develop a theory-based explanation of how geographical distribution provokes team-level conflict. We do so by considering the two characteristics that distinguish dis- tributed teams from traditional ones: Namely, we examine how being distant from one’s team members and relying on technology to mediate communication and collaborative work impacts team members. Our analysis identifies antecedents to conflict that are unique to distributed teams. We predict that conflict of all types (task, affective, and process) will be detri- mental to the performance of distributed teams, a result that is contrary to much research on traditional teams. We also inves- tigate conflict as a dynamic process to determine how teams might mitigate these negative impacts over time.},

abstract = {Prior research on text messaging has focused on its elliptical nature (e.g.; acronyms, etc.). In contrast, the purpose of this research was to conduct an investigation of the type of words that tend to occur in text messages. Participants (N = 224) retrieved their most recent text messages which were then analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program (Pennebaker et al.; 2007a,b) and compared with parallel analyses of randomly selected telephone conversations (N = 214). The results indicated numerous linguistic differences between text messages and telephone conversations. The former were linguistically simpler, more personal and more affective than the latter. Overall, the results further our understanding of the linguistic dimensions of this relatively new form of communication. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a simulator study that examined the effects of distraction upon driving performance for drivers in three age groups. There were two in-vehicle distracter tasks: operating the vehicle entertainment system and conducting a simulated hands-free mobile phone conversation. The effect of visual clutter was examined by requiring participants to drive in simple and complex road environments. Overall measures of driving performance were collected, together with responses to roadway hazards and subjective measures of driver perceived workload. The two in-vehicle distraction tasks degraded overall driving performance, degraded responses to hazards and increased subjective workload. The performance decrements that occurred as a result of in-vehicle distraction were observed in both the simple and complex highway environments and for drivers in different age groups. One key difference was that older drivers traveled at lower mean speeds in the complex highway environment compared with younger drivers. The conclusions of the research are that both in-vehicle tasks impaired several aspects of driving performance, with the entertainment system distracter having the greatest negative impact on performance, and that these findings were relatively stable across different driver age groups and different environmental complexities. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The performance costs associated with cell phone use while driving were assessed meta-analytically using standardized measures of effect size along five dimensions. BACKGROUND: There have been many studies on the impact of cell phone use on driving, showing some mixed findings. METHODS: Twenty-three studies (contributing 47 analysis entries) met the appropriate conditions for the meta-analysis. The statistical results from each of these studies were converted into effect sizes and combined in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, there were clear costs to driving performance when drivers were engaged in cell phone conversations. However, subsequent analyses indicated that these costs were borne primarily by reaction time tasks, with far smaller costs associated with tracking (lane-keeping) performance. Hands-free and handheld phones revealed similar patterns of results for both measures of performance. Conversation tasks tended to show greater costs than did information-processing tasks (e.g., word games). There was a similar pattern of results for passenger and remote (cell phone) conversations. Finally, there were some small differences between simulator and field studies, though both exhibited costs in performance for cell phone use. CONCLUSION: We suggest that (a) there are significant costs to driver reactions to external hazards or events associated with cell phone use, (b) hands-free cell phones do not eliminate or substantially reduce these costs, and (c) different research methodologies or performance measures may underestimate these costs. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the assessment of performance costs attributable to different types of cell phones, cell phone conversations, experimental measures, or methodologies.},

abstract = {In general, the unsafe conditions that are likely to produce a motor vehicle crash reside not at the mean of a given distribution (in other words, under typical conditions), but rather in the tails of the distribution. For example, an unusually slow response to a traffic obstacle, rather than an average response, may result in a collision. Although that situation means that crashes are the exception and not the norm, it has implications for how safety-critical data are approached and handled. In this current paper, experimental data collected in a driving simulator are used to demonstrate how an analysis of the average glance durations to an in-vehicle display might lead to different conclusions about safety compared with an alternative analysis of the tail end of the distribution. In addition, a model of crash risk based on the distribution of in-vehicle glances is described, as well as several characteristics of the traffic environment.},

For assessing cognitive load, physiological data has the advantage of being available in real-time and the potential of assessing the affective components of cognitive load. Described are two new methods of assessing cognitive load from eye tracking and the pressures a subject applies to a computer mouse when subjects perform a math task that involves moving targets. Physiological measures that significantly discriminated task difficulty included eye movement, skin conductivity and one of the pressure signals from the computer mouse. Also, in some cases, these physiological measures can be more sensitive than task performance measures of cognitive load (i.e., incorrect actions) to detect interaction effects with task difficulty. The suite of physiological sensors is shown to be a viable alternative or supplement to task performance measures.},

In this work, we examine the feasibility of building statistical models that can detect and differentiate three granularities (types) of perceptually meaningful breakpoints during task execution, without having to recognize the underlying tasks. We collected ecological samples of task execution data, and asked observers to review the interaction in the collected videos and identify any perceived breakpoints and their type. Statistical methods were applied to learn models that map features of the interaction to each type of breakpoint. Results showed that the models were able to detect and differentiate breakpoints with reasonably high accuracy across tasks. Among many uses, our resulting models can enable interruption management systems to better realize defer-to-breakpoint policies for interactive, free-form tasks.},

Results show that the models detect breakpoints reasonably well, but struggle to differentiate their type. Our second study explored effects of managing notifications with our system on users and their tasks. Results showed that scheduling notifications at breakpoints reduces frustration and reaction time relative to delivering them immediately. We also found that the relevance of notification content determines the type of breakpoint at which it should be delivered. The core concept of scheduling notifications at breakpoints fits well with how users prefer notifications to be managed. This indicates that users would likely adopt the use of notification management systems in practice.},

State legislatures in the U.S. have enacted rules that limit hand-held phone conversations while driving but that allow for hands-free conversations. However, studies have demonstrated that the cognitive load of conversation is a significant source of distraction that increases the likelihood of accidents. We explore in a controlled study with a driving simulator the effectiveness of proactive alerting and mediation of communications during phone conversations while driving. We study the use of auditory messages indicating upcoming critical road conditions and placing calls on hold. We found that such actions reduce driving errors and that alerts sharing details about situations were more effective than general alerts. Drivers found such a system valuable in most situations for maintaining driving safety. These results provide evidence that context-sensitive mediation systems could play a valuable role in focusing drivers‟ attention on the road during phone conversations.},

abstract = {A notification represents the proactive delivery of information to a user and reduces the need to visually scan or repeatedly check an external information source. At the same time, notifications often interrupt user tasks at inopportune moments, decreasing productivity and increasing frus- tration. Controlled studies have shown that linking notification delivery to the perceptual structure of a user’s tasks can reduce these interruption costs.However, in these studies, the scheduling was always performedmanually, and itwas not clearwhether it would be possible for a system tomimic similar techniques. This article contributes the design and implementation of a novel system called Oasis that aligns notification scheduling with the perceptual structure of user tasks. We describe the architecture of the system, how it detects task structure on the fly without explicit knowledge of the task itself, and how it layers flexible notification scheduling policies on top of this detection mechanism. The system also includes an offline tool for creating customized statistical models for detecting task structure. The value of our system is that it intelligently schedules notifications, enabling the reductions in interruption costs shown within prior controlled studies to now be re- alized by users in everyday desktop computing tasks. It also provides a test bed for experimenting with how notification management policies and other system functionalities can be linked to task structure.},

abstract = {As multimedia become an integral part of collaborative systems, we must understand how to design such systems to support the user's rich set of existing interaction skills, rather than requiring people to adapt to arbitrary constraints of technology-driven designs. To understand how we can make effective use of video in remote collaboration, we compared a small team's interactions through a desktop video conferencing prototype with face-to-face interactions and phone conversations. We found that, compared with audio-only, the video channel of our desktop video conferencing prototype adds or improves the ability to show understanding, forecast responses, give nonverbal information, enhance verbal descriptions, manage pauses, and express attitudes. These findings suggest that video may be better than the phone for handling conflict and other interaction-intense activities. However, the advantages of video depend critically on the nearly-instantaneous transmission of audio, even if it means getting out of sync with the video image. Nonetheless, when compared with face-to-face interaction, it can be difficult in video interactions to notice peripheral cues, control the floor, have side conversations, point to things or manipulate real-world objects. To enable rich interactions fully, video should be integrated with other distributed tools that increase the extent and type of shared space in a way that enables natural collaborative behaviors within those environments.},

Studying face-to-face in- teractions in small groups helps in understanding the basic processes of individual and group behavior; and improving team productivity and satisfaction in the modern work- place. Apart fromthe verbal channel, nonverbal behavioral cues forma rich communica- tion channel through which people infer - often automatically and unconsciously - emo- tions, relationships, and traits of fellowmembers. There exists a solid body of knowledge about small groups and themultimodal nature of the nonverbal phenomenon in social psychology and nonverbal communication. How- ever, the problemhas only recently begunto be studied in themultimodalprocessing com- munity. A recent trend is to analyze these interactions in the context of face-to-face group conversations, usingmultiple sensors andmake inferences automaticallywithout theneed of a human expert. These problems can be formulated in a machine learning framework involving the extraction of relevant audio, video features and the design of supervised or unsupervised learningmodels. While attempting to bridge social psychology, perception, and machine learning, cer- tain factors have to be considered. Firstly, various group conversation patterns emerge at different time-scales. For example, turn-taking patterns evolve over shorter time scales, whereas dominance or group-interest trends get established over larger time scales. Sec- ondly, a set of audio and visual cues that are not only relevant but also robustly computable need to be chosen. Thirdly, unlike typicalmachine learning problems where ground truth iswell defined, interactionmodeling involves data annotation that needs to factor in inter- annotator variability. Finally, principled ways of intergrating themultimodal cues have to be investigated.},

abstract = {Recent research associated with three major types of effect of noise on human performance is discussed: 1) Loud noise influences information processing by inducing verbal strategies which may persist after the noise has been turned off, and if verbal strategies are already in use, noise encourages their more fervent adoption. 2) Loud noise also elevates the person's state of arousal. Its effects are qualitatively similar to the effects of fatigue due to mental work and, in some ways, to the effects of wakefulness over the day. 3) Irrelevant speech interferes with reading and memory. The effects appear to be independent of intensity and, for memory at least, independent of the meaning of the speech. Speech appears to have privileged access to (and hence opportunities to disrupt) high-level processing mechanisms essential to efficiency in children's reading and to performance in the modern office environment. Arising from an analysis of these findings, a number of emerging research issues are discussed.},

abstract = {As computer applications for cars emerge, a speech-based interface offers an appealing alternative to the visually demanding direct manipulation interface. However, speech-based systems may pose cognitive demands that could undermine driving safety. This study used a car-following task to evaluate how a speech-based e-mail system affects drivers' response to the periodic braking of a lead vehicle. The study included 24 drivers between the ages of 18 and 24 years. A baseline condition with no e-mail system was compared with a simple and a complex e-mail system in both simple and complex driving environments. The results show a 30\% (310 ms) increase in reaction time when the speech-based system is used. Subjective workload ratings and probe questions also indicate that speech-based interaction introduces a significant cognitive load, which was highest for the complex e-mail system. These data show that a speech-based interface is not a panacea that eliminates the potential distraction of in-vehicle computers. Actual or potential applications of this research include design of in-vehicle information systems and evaluation of their contributions to driver distraction.},

Our findings reveal that these interruptions rarely happen (at most 10\% of the daily application usage), but when they do, they may introduce a significant overhead (can delay completion of a task by up to 4 times). We conclude with a discussion of the results, their limitations, and a series of implications for the design of mobile phones.},

aesthetics and presents an empirical investigation of sound

The theoretical discussion examines the relationship between sound aesthetics and user satisfaction and concludes that, despite the creation of numerous auditory design methods and guidelines, none are dedicated to achieving aesthetically pleasing designs. In a case study, an empirical investigation is conducted to evaluate the relationship between the functional and aesthetic value of an auditory interface. By investigating two different tasks, this study demonstrates that the nature of the tasks allocated to subjects has a significant
impact on the aesthetic judgments made by the subjects.
Consequently, functional and aesthetic properties of auditory cannot be dealt with independently.},

abstract = {In typical dual-task driving studies, participants concurrently perform pairs of driving-related and -unrelated tasks (e.g. vehicle braking and mental arithmetic). Requiring responses to both may implicitly equate their importance. In real-life driving, however, the potential for collision dictates that a concurrent task should be assigned far lower priority than driving. To better reflect naturalistic driving conditions, we not only instructed participants to assign maximum priority to braking in a simulated driving task, but also encouraged them to ignore the concurrent task altogether on dual-task trials. Despite these instructions, responses to the concurrent task often preceded braking, which suffered from dual-task interference.We also found that redundant signals to the lead vehicle’s brake lights resulted in faster braking responses and an increased likelihood that the braking response would occur first. The results are consistent with the Central Bottleneck (CB) model of dual-task interference and may help guide the design of driver-assistance systems.},

This paper will survey several of these applications and reflect on interface design principles that enable successful use of common sense knowledge.},

Traditionally, hardware and software were conceptualized as input/output systems: systems that took input, explicitly given to them by a human, and acted upon that input alone to produce an explicit output. Now, this view is seen as being too restrictive. Smart computers, intelligent agent software, and digital devices of the future will have to operate on data that are not explicitly given to them, data that they observe or gather for themselves. These operations may be dependent on time, place, weather, user preferences, or the history of interaction. In other words, context. But what, exactly, is context? We look at perspectives from software agents, sensors, and embedded devices, and also contrast traditional mathematical and formal approaches. We see how each treats the problem of context and discuss the implications for design of context-sensitive hardware and software.},

abstract = {The importance of understanding cognitive load in driving scenarios cannot be stressed enough. With a better management of cognitive resources, many accidents could be avoided, hence it is one of the most critical variables that user experiments attempt to investigate when new in-car systems are introduced. Since there is currently no way to measure it directly, it is often estimated via its impact on primary task performance. Driver assistance systems have traditionally sported rather simple and uni-modal HMIs, but the recent increase in variety of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) suggests that a more distinguished look at measurement tasks may be needed. Our research indicates that the few established tasks may not be suitable for estimating distraction in all cases, which consequently makes them an unreliable predictor for cognitive load. For the specific conditions we require in our investigation (e.g. continuity, controllable difficulty etc.), we propose the ConTRe (Continuous Tracking and Reaction) Task, which complements the de-facto standard lane change test in order to provide more insight in these cases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design rationale for a group drawing tool exploiting localised auditory cues to describe user activities. Our hypothesis is that these cues are important for two reasons. Firstly, they make participants aware of the details of execution of peer activities. This is especially significant when these activities are out of visual focus. Secondly, they convey intentionality information among participants. The later has been found to influence significantly inter-participant conversations during real world collaborative drawing activities. Our approach for adding sounds to the group drawing environment involves associating localised auditory messages to the palette, tools, primitive drawing objects and cursors representing metaphoric hands or points of gaze. These mappings give rise to dynamic soundscapes describing operations being or intended to be performed. We discuss the auditory authoring and browsing techniques involved in our group drawing environment together with their implications for the design of future collaborative environments involving auditory ecologies},

Interruptions occur as an unavoidable side-effect of some important kinds of human computer-based activities, for example, (a) constantly monitor for unscheduled changes in information environments, (b) supervise background autonomous services, and (c) intermittently collaborate and communicate with other people. Fortunately, people have powerful innate cognitive abilities that they can potentially leverage to manage multiple concurrent activities if they have specific kinds of control and interaction support. There is great opportunity, therefore, for user-interface design to increase people's ability to successfully handle interruptions, and prevent expensive errors.

Coordination support, however, is identified as a most important design topic. This article presents the results of an empirical investigation to compare basic design solutions for coordinating human interruption in computer-based multitasks. A theory-based taxonomy of human interruption is used to identify the four primary methods for coordinating human interruption. An experiment with 36 participants compares these four different design solutions within an abstracted common user multitasking context. The results show important design tradeoffs for coordinating the interruption of people in HCI and support some UI design guidelines.

The study focussed the cognitive component of the conversations, excluding dialling. The cognitive demands of the conversations were varied and in two of the experiments the same tasks had two versions: by phone and in live conversation with the experimenter in the car. Several dependent measures like visual search behaviour, driving speed, visual detection and response selection capacities and others were analysed. Like in previous experiments of the same authors the more demanding cognitive tasks produced higher interference effects, but when the same tasks performed by phone were compared with its live versions no differences were observed. Once the manual phone operation has been technically suppressed the risk of phone conversations relies on the demands of the message content and its equivalent to talking to a passenger.

abstract = {Giant strides in information technology at the turn of the century may have unleashed unreachable goals. With the invention of groupware, people expect to communicate easily with each other and accomplish difficult work even though they are remotely located or rarely overlap in time. Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make "virtual collocation" possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of "collaboratories." We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.},

abstract = {Giant strides in information technology at the turn of the century may have unleashed unreachable goals. With the invention of groupware, people expect to communicate easily with each other and accomplish difficult work even though they are remotely located or rarely overlap in time. Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make "virtual collocation" possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of "collaboratories." We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.},

abstract = {A simulator and a field experiment were conducted to study the effects of visual and cognitive load on driving performance, and also to assess the validity on the VTI simulator as a tool for studying the effects of distraction. It was found that visual load resulted in deteriorated lateral control and to some extent reduced speed control, although there was a clear effect of the drivers reducing their speed and increasing the steering activity in order to compensate for the increased visual load. Cognitive load resulted in somewhat reduced speed control, but more clearly, increased steering activity and more stable lane keeping. This increase in lateral control was interpreted as the drivers in precaution creating a larger safety margin in case of an unexpected event, which they were assumed to be less capable to react to due to the cognitive load. The simulator validity was found to be very high, except from that less realistic risk in the simulator seemed to result in less level of stress and higher travel speed in the simulator.},

The goal of this special issue on interdisciplinary perspectives is to capitalize on the theoretical advances made over the last 50 years by synthesizing and integrating models and theories on small groups proposed by various disciplines into a set of general theoretical perspectives. In this introduction, the authors identify nine general theoretical perspectives from which small groups have been examined: the psychodynamic, functional, temporal, conflict-power-status, symbolic-interpretive, social identity, social-evolutionary, social network, and feminist perspectives. This article summarizes each theoretical perspective briefly and then offers some observations about the perspectives as a whole. Articles describing three of these interdisciplinary perspectives appear in this special issue, and four other perspectives will be introduced in the next issue.},

abstract = {Gesture and speech combine to form a rich basis for human conversational interaction. To exploit these modalities in HCI, we need to understand the interplay between them and the way in which they support communication. We propose a framework for the gesture research done to date, and present our work on the cross-modal cues for discourse segmentation in free-form gesticulation accompanying speech in natural conversation as a new paradigm for such multimodal interaction. The basis for this integration is the psycholinguistic concept of the co-equal generation of gesture and speech from the same semantic intent. We present a detailed case study of a gesture and speech elicitation experiment in which a subject describes her living space to an interlocutor. We perform two independent sets of analyses on the video and audio data: video and audio analysis to extract segmentation cues, and expert transcription of the speech and gesture data by micro-analyzing the video tape using a frame-accurate video player to correlate the speech with the gestural entities. We compare the results of both analyses to identify the cues accessible in the gestural and audio data that correlate well with the expert psycholinguistic analysis. We show that ‘handedness’ and the kind of symmetry in two-handed gestures provide effective supersegmental discourse cues.},

@article{redelmeier1997,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because of a belief that the use of cellular telephones while driving may cause collisions, several countries have restricted their use in motor vehicles, and others are considering such regulations. We used an epidemiologic method, the case-crossover design, to study whether using a cellular telephone while driving increases the risk of a motor vehicle collision. METHODS: We studied 699 drivers who had cellular telephones and who were involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in substantial property damage but no personal injury. Each person's cellular-telephone calls on the day of the collision and during the previous week were analyzed through the use of detailed billing records. RESULTS: A total of 26,798 cellular-telephone calls were made during the 14-month study period. The risk of a collision when using a cellular telephone was four times higher than the risk when a cellular telephone was not being used (relative risk, 4.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 6.5). The relative risk was similar for drivers who differed in personal characteristics such as age and driving experience; calls close to the time of the collision were particularly hazardous (relative risk, 4.8 for calls placed within 5 minutes of the accident, as compared with 1.3 for calls placed more than 15 minutes before the accident; P<0.001); and units that allowed the hands to be free (relative risk, 5.9) offered no safety advantage over hand-held units (relative risk, 3.9; P not significant). Thirty-nine percent of the drivers called emergency services after the collision, suggesting that having a cellular telephone may have had advantages in the aftermath of an event. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cellular telephones in motor vehicles is associated with a quadrupling of the risk of a collision during the brief time interval involving a call. Decisions about regulation of such telephones, however, need to take into account the benefits of the technology and the role of individual responsibility.},

results of our investigation suggest that it is possible to communicate

considering the characteristics of the problem domain and their

abstract = {In this study, a combined measure was developed based on various physiological indices in order to evaluate the mental workload during a dual task. To determine the mental effort required for each task, three physiological signals were recorded while ten subjects performed different versions of a dual task composed of tracking and mental arithmetic. These signals were the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG), which were transformed into the suppression of alpha rhythm, eye blink interval, and heart rate variability (HRV), respectively. The alpha suppression provided proper information to infer the efforts for the arithmetic task, but not for the tracking task. Conversely, the blink interval and HRV permitted detailed inferences over the workload of the tracking task, but not for the arithmetic task. These results can be explained in terms of the multiple resources model of workload. The processing indexed by the alpha suppression is inferred to be different from that indexed by the blink interval or HRV. Finally, the physiological measures were combined into a single measure using different weight coefficients. The newly developed measure systematically increased with the difficulty of each task and significantly distinguished between the different versions of each task. Relevance to industry A combined measure of mental workload that has the ability to evaluate operators' mental effort in a multitask condition would be valuable in a natural working environment, because most such work is composed of multiple tasks. In this paper, an approach is described that developed a combined measure of mental workload based on three physiological indices. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With recent advances in interactive media, multimodal user interfaces are becoming popular but our current understanding on how to design such systems is still primitive. In the absence of generalizable theories and models, the WOz technique is an appropriate approach to the identification of sound design solutions. We show how the WOz technique can be extended to the analysis of multimodal interfaces and we formulate a set of requirements for a generic multimodal WOz platform. The Neimo system is presented as an illustration of our early experience in the development of such platforms.},

abstract = {ObjectiveWe assess the driving distraction potential of texting with Google Glass (Glass), a mobile wearable platform capable of receiving and sending short-message-service and other messaging formats. BackgroundA known roadway danger, texting while driving has been targeted by legislation and widely banned. Supporters of Glass claim the head-mounted wearable computer is designed to deliver information without concurrent distraction. Existing literature supports the supposition that design decisions incorporated in Glass might facilitate messaging for drivers. MethodWe asked drivers in a simulator to drive and use either Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface, then interrupted them with an emergency brake event. Both the response event and subsequent recovery were analyzed. ResultsGlass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting cognitive demands. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multitasking. ConclusionGlass in not a panacea as some supporters claim, but it does point the way to design interventions that effect reduced load in multitasking. ApplicationDiscussions of these identified benefits are framed within the potential of new in-vehicle systems that bring both novel forms of distraction and tools for mitigation into the driver's seat.},

People (cf. the Social Web), places (cf. the Geo Web), and physical objects (cf. ubiquitous computing, the Internet of Things) are increasingly infused with sensors, actuators, and tagged with a wealth of digital information. Urban informatics research explores these emerging digital layers of the city at the intersection of people, place and technology. However, little is known about the challenges and new opportunities that these digital layers may offer to road users driving through today's mega cities. We argue that this aspect is worth exploring in particular with regards to Auto-UI's overarching goal of making cars both safer and more enjoyable. This paper presents the findings of a pilot study, which included 14 urban informatics research experts participating in a guided ideation (idea creation) workshop within a simulated environment. They were immersed into different driving scenarios to imagine novel urban informatics type of applications specific to the driving context.},

abstract = {User interfaces can be difficult to master. Typically, when a user has a problem understanding the interface, computers respond with generic, difficult-to-interpret feedback. This is a case study of Cognitive Adaptive Computer Help (COACH), an example of a style of intelligent agent which gives more effective responses when problems occur in the interface between people and computers. It implements a cognitive interface which attempts to recognize the needs of a user and responds proactively as the user is typing. It records and analyzes user actions to adapt computer responses to the individual, offering useful help information even before the user requests it. The approach uses dynamic models of both the user and the domain of knowledge the user is learning. These models teach and guide a user. COACH was first used in a study which validated real-time learning and reasoning in computer interface can improve users' productivity and comfort with an interface. COACH was designed to facilitate development and study of adaptive help systems. The help given the user, the domain in which the user is being coached, even the way the system adapts to the user, are represented in frames and controlled by rules which can he changed. COACH was first tested in teaching the problem domain of writing Lisp programs. To demonstrate the generality of COACH for teaching arbitrary problem domains, help systems were then created for the UNIX command language and GML text formatting language. In the original text-based COACH implementation, a new problem domain can he supported simply by defining the syntax of the domain and writing the help text. The ideas have been applied to a modern graphical user interface (GUI) in a product version created for the OS/2 and Windows 95 GUIs. This COACH/2 system uses new teaching techniques to graphically demonstrate GUI syntax and procedures. A see-through technique called masking draws users' attention to GUI objects. An animation technique called slug trails walks the user through graphical procedures. COACH/2 also includes a WYSIWYG authoring approach and tool to extend the notion of the system being a shell for creating adaptive help systems. This tool automatically picks up syntax from the graphical interaction with the author, so only the help text itself needs to be written. The architecture is available as WarpGuides in the OS/2 Warp 4 release. WarpGuides show a user how to perform graphical actions in a graphical user interface. Current development work with COACH/2 is exploring 3-d animation.mixing adaptive computer help with adaptive tutoring. ?? 1998 Academic Press.},

We show performance improving systems: an instant message arrives after you have finished typing a sentence, not while you are forming it; a car waits for you to complete a difficult maneuver before giving you distracting feedback.This work relies on dynamic task, user, system, and communication models.

Systems in which visual cues were absent produced no differences in turn-taking or any other aspect of conversational structure. Turn-taking was unaffected even when visual information was completely absent. Only the same-room condition showed any significant differences from any other condition; people in the same room produced more interruptions and fewer formal handovers of the floor than in technology-mediated conditions. Analyses of Ss' perceptions showed that visual access in mediated conversations was both important and beneficial in conversation. There were indications that the particular design of the different video systems affected some aspects of conversational behavior, such as the ability to hold side and parallel conversations.

In this paper, we describe our attempt to use a physiological measure, namely Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), to objectively evaluate users’ stress and arousal levels while using unimodal and multimodal versions of the same interface. Preliminary results show that users’ GSR readings significantly increase when task cognitive load level increases. Moreover, users’ GSR readings are found to be lower when using a multimodal interface, instead of a unimodal interface. Cross-examination of GSR data with multimodal data annotation showed promising results in explaining the peaks in the GSR data, which are found to correlate with sub-task user events. This interesting result verifies that GSR can be used to serve as an objective indicator of user cognitive load level in real time, with a very fine granularity.},

abstract = {The advent of new propulsion technologies (e.g., hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell, and electric) changes the vehicle noise signature dramatically. Traditional powertrain sounds disappear and new sounds become audible, including those from alternative propulsion systems, power converters, and from the car's structure itself due to road noise, tire sounds, and vibration from the body frame. In the face of such developments, feedback to the driver regarding vehicle state is greatly changed, which may cause confusion and frustration. Our work explores the addition of sound cues to a vehicle’s interior environment to increase drivers’ aural feedback for states such as “ready to go”, “systems off”, and “alert”. We discuss the design and evaluation of such cues for an electric vehicle, and relate this to background research in the areas of psychoacoustics, sonic branding, and auditory interfaces.},

abstract = {As the availability, affordability, and popularity of mobile phones has increased in the last decade, text messaging has become one of the primary means of communication among adolescent peer groups. As such, it can be speculated that mobile phones and text messaging have become an integral aspect of the culture of young people today. However, little research has of yet identified how people react to an absence of texting behavior. This study attempts to demonstrate the extent to which people have become reliant upon text messaging to maintain daily relationships with peers, as well as their own self-concept. Frequencies and patterns of alternative behaviors, non-compliance, and anxiety are measured during separate restriction periods among a group of high and low text users, ages 18-23. Results indicate that there was a significant difference between individuals identified as 'high' and 'low' text users, although regardless of this distinction, texting emerged as the preferred form of contact among peers within this cohort. A high degree of quantitatively and qualitatively reported anxiety during periods of restriction was also noted, suggesting that this behavior has become an integrated element of daily living for this group. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance was not disrupted by listening to radio broadcasts or listening to a book on tape. Nor was it disrupted by a continuous shadowing task using a handheld phone, ruling out, in this case, dual-task interpretations associated with holding the phone, listening, or speaking, However significant interference was observed in a word-generation variant of the shadowing task, and this deficit increased with the difficulty of driving. Moreover unconstrained conversations using either a handheld or a hands-free cell phone resulted in a twofold increase in the failure to detect simulated traffic signals and slower reactions to those signals that were detected.

Moreover, this pattern was obtained for objects of both high- and low-relevance, suggesting that very little semantic analysis of the objects occurs outside the restricted focus of attention. These data support the inattention- blindness interpretation in which the disruptive effects of cell phone conversations on driving are due in large part to the diversion of attention from driving to the phone conversation.

Compared with single-task (i.e., driving-only) conditions, when drivers used cell phones their reactions were 18\% slower, their following distance was 12\% greater, and they took 17\% longer to recover the speed that was lost following braking. There was also a twofold increase in the number of rear-end collisions when drivers were conversing on a cell phone. These cell-phone-induced effects were equivalent for younger and older adults, suggesting that older adults do not suffer a significantly greater penalty for talking on a cell phone while driving than compared with their younger counterparts.

The purpose of this research was to provide a direct comparison of the driving performance of a cell phone driver and a drunk driver in a controlled laboratory setting. METHOD: We used a high-fidelity driving simulator to compare the performance of cell phone drivers with drivers who were intoxicated from ethanol (i.e., blood alcohol concentration at 0.08\% weight/volume). RESULTS: When drivers were conversing on either a handheld or hands-free cell phone, their braking reactions were delayed and they were involved in more traffic accidents than when they were not conversing on a cell phone. By contrast, when drivers were intoxicated from ethanol they exhibited a more aggressive driving style, following closer to the vehicle immediately in front of them and applying more force while braking. CONCLUSION: When driving conditions and time on task were controlled for, the impairments associated with using a cell phone while driving can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to determine the relative impairment associated with conversing on a cellular telephone while driving. BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests that the relative risk of being in a traffic accident while using a cell phone is similar to the hazard associated with driving with a blood alcohol level at the legal limit. The purpose of this research was to provide a direct comparison of the driving performance of a cell phone driver and a drunk driver in a controlled laboratory setting. METHOD: We used a high-fidelity driving simulator to compare the performance of cell phone drivers with drivers who were intoxicated from ethanol (i.e., blood alcohol concentration at 0.08\% weight/volume). RESULTS: When drivers were conversing on either a handheld or hands-free cell phone, their braking reactions were delayed and they were involved in more traffic accidents than when they were not conversing on a cell phone. By contrast, when drivers were intoxicated from ethanol they exhibited a more aggressive driving style, following closer to the vehicle immediately in front of them and applying more force while braking. CONCLUSION: When driving conditions and time on task were controlled for, the impairments associated with using a cell phone while driving can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk. APPLICATION: This research may help to provide guidance for regulation addressing driver distraction caused by cell phone conversations.},

abstract = {This research examined the effects of hands-free cell phone conversations on simulated driving. The authors found that these conversations impaired driver's reactions to vehicles braking in front of them. The authors assessed whether this impairment could be attributed to a withdrawal of attention from the visual scene, yielding a form of inattention blindness. Cell phone conversations impaired explicit recognition memory for roadside billboards. Eye-tracking data indicated that this was due to reduced attention to foveal information. This interpretation was bolstered by data showing that cell phone conversations impaired implicit perceptual memory for items presented at fixation. The data suggest that the impairment of driving performance produced by cell phone conversations is mediated, at least in part, by reduced attention to visual inputs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Usable real-time displays of intravenous anesthetic concentrations and effects could significantly enhance intraoperative clinical decision-making. Pharmacokinetic models are available to estimate past, present, and future drug effect-site concentrations, and pharmacodynamic models are available to predict the drug's associated physiologic effects. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team (bioengineering, architecture, anesthesiology, computer engineering, and cognitive psychology) developed a graphic display that presents the real-time effect-site concentrations, normalized to the drugs' EC(95), of intravenous drugs. Graphical metaphors were created to show the drugs' pharmacodynamics. To evaluate the effect of the display on the management of total intravenous anesthesia, 15 anesthesiologists participated in a computer-based simulation study. The participants cared for patients during two experimental conditions: with and without the drug display. RESULTS: With the drug display, clinicians administered more bolus doses of remifentanil during anesthesia maintenance. There was a significantly lower variation in the predicted effect-site concentrations for remifentanil and propofol, and effect-site concentrations were maintained closer to the drugs' EC(95). There was no significant difference in the simulated patient heart rate and blood pressure with respect to experimental condition. The perceived performance for the participants was increased with the drug display, whereas mental demand, effort, and frustration level were reduced. In a post-simulation questionnaire, participants rated the display to be a useful addition to anesthesia monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The drug display altered simulated clinical practice. These results, which will inform the next iteration of designs and evaluations, suggest promise for this approach to drug data visualization.},

abstract = {Using glance-monitoring technologies for on-road studies is an excellent way to investigate driver behaviors in an ecologically valid setting. Recent advances in glance-monitoring technologies have made it possible to conduct on-road studies of drivers' glance behavior that heretofore were simply not possible. Yet it is not always easy to determine which glance-monitoring technology to use for a particular application. Here, we first identify the generic capabilities of the various glance-monitoring technologies. We then describe how particular glance-monitoring technologies have been used in the field to (a) identify the skill deficiencies of novice and older drivers, (b) evaluate the effectiveness of training programs that are designed to reduce deficits in these skills, and (c) address interface issues both inside (e.g., collision warning systems) and outside (e.g., yield markings) the vehicle. The limitations and advantages of on-road eye-tracking and the associated glance-monitoring technologies are identified throughout. A comparison, where possible, is made between the results of on-road eye-tracking studies of drivers' behaviors and the results of those studies conducted in the laboratory. Overall, the use of appropriate onroad glance-monitoring technologies has greatly enhanced our theoretical understanding of why drivers behave the way they do, and this knowledge has paved the way for significant improvements in road user safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper discusses the impact of an adaptive prototype in-car communication system (ICCS), called MIMI (Multimodal Interface for Mobile Info-communication), on driver distraction. Existing ICCSs attempt to minimise the visual and manual distraction, but more research needs to be done to reduce cognitive distraction. MIMI was designed to address usability and safety issues with existing ICCSs. Few ICCSs available today consider the driver’s context in the design of the user interface. An adaptive user interface (AUI) was designed and integrated into a conventional dialogue system in order to prevent the driver from receiving calls and sending text messages under high distraction conditions. The current distraction level is detected by a neural network using the driving speed and steering wheel angle of the car as inputs. An adaptive version of MIMI was compared to a non-adaptive version in a user study conducted using a simple driving simulator. The results obtained showed that the adaptive version provided several usability and safety benefits, including reducing the cognitive load, and that the users preferred the adaptive version.},

annote = {In-vehicle driver distractions are an increasing cause of automobile accidents. Recent advances in wearable consumer technologies impose new challenges for managing driver attention and regulating device use in the driving context. Google Glass is a wearable interface that presents information via a heads-up display and read aloud function, neither of which obstructs the user’s view of the surrounding environment. While Glass may benefit drivers by providing driving-related notifications, no documentation exists objectively measuring the extent to which using Glass impacts driving performance and safety. This preliminary study compared texting with Google Glass to other texting methods in a driving simulation to examine driver behavior and performance. While texting-and-driving is inadvisable, the task of texting may be constructed so that it does not provide information that alters the intent of the driving task, reducing confounding factors in analysis of the device’s impact on driving performance. The results of this study suggest that Glass performs much clos-er to baseline than the other technologies. Evidence from this preliminary investigation was used to form a complete study evaluating texting-and-driving with Google Glass. Results from these studies can be used to inform developers of wearable technologies and policymakers tasked with regulating the use of these tech-nologies while driving.},

abstract = {The study was concerned with effects of handsfree and handheld mobile phone dialling and conversation in simulated driving. In the main experiment dealing with conversation, 48 participants drove a distance of about 70 km on a route which led through urban and rural environments. In the dialling experiment, the participants drove a distance of 15 km on a rural two-lane road. The experimental design was mixed with phone mode as a between-subjects factor and phone use (yes/no) as a within-subjects factor. Performance on a peripheral detection task (PDT) while driving was impaired by dialling and conversation for both phone modes, interpreted as an increase in mental workload. Driving performance was impaired by dialling--lateral position deviation increased in a similar way for both phone modes. Conversation had, however, opposite effects--lateral position deviation decreased in a similar way for both phone modes. Driving speed decreased as an effect of dialling with the greatest effect for handsfree phone mode. Conversation also caused reduced speed, but only for handheld phone mode. The effects on speed can be interpreted as a compensatory effort for the increased mental workload. In spite of the compensatory behaviour, mental workload was still markedly increased by phone use. Subjective effects of dialling and conversation were also analysed. Most participants reported a speed decrease but no effect on lateral position deviation as an effect of dialling or conversation. In the conversation experiment, driving performance was rated better for handsfree than for handheld mode. In the dialling experiment, no difference between the two phone modes appeared.},

abstract = {Rational agents are important objects of study in several research communities, including economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and most recently computer science and articial intelligence. Crudely, a rational agent is an entity that is capable of acting on its environment, and which chooses to act in such a way as to further its own best interests. There has recently been much interest in the use of mathematical logic for developing formal theories of such agents. Such theories view agents as practical reasoning systems, deciding moment by moment which action to perform next, given the beliefs they have about the world and their desires with respect to how they would like the world to be. In this article, we survey the state of the art in developing logical theories of rational agency. Following a discussion on the dimensions along which such theories can vary, we brieﬂy survey the logical tools available in order to construct such theories. We then review and critically assess three of the best known theories of rational agency: Cohen and Levesque's intention logic, Rao and Georgeﬀ's BDI logics, and the KARO framework of Meyer et al. We then discuss the various roles that such logics can play in helping us to engineer rational agents, and conclude with a discussion of open problems.},

Palmar skin conductance recording positions are, however, not always preferred for ambulatory recordings in real-life situations. This study quantifies the responsiveness and similarity with the finger of 16 different recording positions of skin conductance while watching emotional film fragments. Findings indicated foot, fingers and shoulders being most responsive, whereas arm, back, armpit, and thighbone were least responsive. The measurements at the foot were most similar with those of the finger. In contrast, arm, back, and armpit traces differed most from the finger trace. Taken together, foot and shoulders are the best alternatives to the finger for ambulatory measurement of skin conductance to reflect emotional arousal. These findings can help new applications using skin conductance, like automated emotion measurements, to come to fruition.},

abstract = {Context-sensitive systems (CSS) are computer systems that use context to provide more relevant services or information to support users performing their tasks, where context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation in which something exists or occurs. CSS demand that designers consider new aspects and challenges in comparison to traditional applications. In a preliminary experiment, we observed that developers find it difficult to include the concept of context in their applications. However, only few approaches offer integrated domain-independent support on developing CSS. This paper presents an integrated approach to assist the design of CSS. The originality of this work lies on the proposed way of thinking about context, on the proposed context metamodel and on the specification of a process for designing CSS. The metamodel supports building context models by making explicit the concepts related to context manipulation and by separating the context structure model from the CSS behavior model. The design process details the main activities related to context specification and the design of CSS, providing a systematic way to execute these tasks. This work also advances the state of the art related to the understanding of the concept of context (and its associated concepts). Three experimental studies were conducted to evaluate the proposal: its instantiation in the design of a context-sensitive Expert Recommender System, its usage by distinct designers on their CSS projects, and a qualitative evaluation of the overall proposal by experienced CSS developers. These studies showed a good acceptance of our approach and indicated the feasibility of using it on real projects. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {What unites CSCW research is the need to help people work together (Greif, 1988) or, to be more precise, "...the support requirements of cooperative work." (Bannon \& Schmidt, 1989). An important contribution to the understanding of these requirements, therefore, are the results from research into group working, its structure, and dynamics. A well recognised concept in group work is the role of the group facilitator; someone who's responsibility it is to assist the group in achieving its objectives. This recognition, however, is not yet reflected by work published under the CSCW banner. This paper aims to take a first step at addressing this omission. 1 Introduction},

abstract = {In-vehicle dialogue systems demand dialogue management that takes the cognitive workload of the driver into consideration. When doing so, it is important to distinguish between two types of cognitive load, namely cognitive load that is driving-induced, i.e. that affects the driving behaviour, or dialogue-induced, i.e. arise from the dialogue itself. In the first case we believe that the dialogue should pause to let the driver concentrate on the driving task, while in the second case the dialogue system should reformulate its question to make the dialogue task easier for the driver. We will present a novel theory of how to do this, and also present findings from a user study made in the DICO project.},

@inproceedings{Walker:2006,
abstract = {With shrinking displays and increasing technology use by visually impaired users, it is important to improve usability with non-GUI interfaces such as menus. Using non-speech sounds called earcons or auditory icons has been proposed to enhance menu navigation. We compared search time and accuracy of menu navigation using four types of auditory representations: speech only; hierarchical earcons; auditory icons; and a new type called spearcons. Spearcons are created by speeding up a spoken phrase until it is not recognized as speech. Using a within-subjects design, participants searched a 5 x 5 menu for target items using each type of audio cue. Spearcons and speech-only both led to faster and more accurate menu navigation than auditory icons and hierarchical earcons. There was a significant practice effect for search time, within each type of auditory cue. These results suggest that spearcons are more effective than previous auditory cues in menu-based interfaces, and may lead to better performance and accuracy, as well as more flexible menu structures. Author Keywords Spearcons, earcons, auditory icons, speech interfaces, menu navigation.},

One particular application of the theory, the 4-dimensional multiple resources model, is described in detail, positing that there will be greater interference between two tasks to the extent that they share stages (perceptual/cognitive vs response) sensory modalities (auditory vs visual), codes (visual vs spatial) and channels of visual information (focal vs ambient). A computational rendering of this model is then presented. Examples are given of how the model predicts interference differences in operational envir- onments. Finally, three challenges to the model are outlined regarding task demand coding, task allocation and visual resource competition.},

abstract = {Piloting an aircraft is a complex task that places demands on several aspects of a pilot’s cognitive capabilities. Because of the multifaceted nature of flying, several measures are required to identify the effects of these demands on the pilot. Several psychophysiological measures were recorded so that a wider understanding of the effects of these demands could be achieved. Heart rate, heart rate variability, eye blinks, electrodermal activity, topographically recorded electrical brain activity, and subjective estimates of mental workload were recorded. Ten pilots flew an approx- imately 90-min scenario containing both visual and instrument flight conditions. To determine the reliability of the psychophysiological measures, the pilots flew the same scenario twice. The responses during the 2 flights were essentially identical. Cardiac and electrodermal measures were highly correlated and exhibited changes in response to the various demands of the flights. Heart rate variability was less sen- sitive than heart rate. Alpha and delta bands of the brain activity showed significant changes to the varying demands of the scenarios. Blink rates decreased during the more highly visually demanding segments of the flights.},

abstract = {Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor--often called "general intelligence"--emerges from the correlations among people's performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of "collective intelligence" exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group's performance on a wide variety of tasks. This "c factor" is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades the concept of driver distraction has been the focus of intense research attention. One aspect of distraction for which there has been limited systematic research, however, is its role in driver error causation. This article presents a review of the distraction literature with a view to elucidating what is currently known about the types of driving errors that distraction contributes to and the mechanisms by which distraction induces these errors. The review revealed a number of fundamental gaps in our knowledge, including the number and nature of errors made by drivers when distracted; the mechanisms by which distraction causes errors; whether and how distraction disrupts drivers' ability to recover from errors; and how system-wide factors moderate the relationship between distraction and error. In closing, we attempt to identify the most appropriate theoretical and methodological approach to drive the integrated study of distraction and error forward. We conclude that it is only through the adoption of a systems approach that integrated countermeasures can be proposed and implemented to mitigate driver errors caused by distraction. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article argues that future generations of computer-based systems will need cognitive user interfaces to achieve sufficiently robust and intelligent human interaction. These cognitive user interfaces will be characterized by the ability to support inference and reasoning, planning under uncertainty, short-term adaptation, and long-term learning from experience. An appropriate engineering framework for such interfaces is provided by partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that integrate Bayesian belief tracking and reward-based reinforcement learning. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated by the example of a simple gesture-driven interface to an iPhone application. Furthermore, evidence is provided that humans appear to use similar mechanisms for planning under uncertainty.},
