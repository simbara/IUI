\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This paper demonstrates advantages of measuring pupil fluctuation for recognizing cognitive load. Instantaneous heart rate, pulse transit time, heart rate variability, and Galvanic skin response were not good predictors of task difficulty for an overloaded driver experiencing complex sensory motor coordination with notifications.  Pupil fluctuation, on the other hand, was over 80 percent correct at distinguishing low and high task load  within 5 seconds. The paper presents a database with high and low task load regions that can be used by researchers for training across a variety of sensors for task load examination.  
A second experiment is presented which productively tracks high and low driving task loads with a pupil dilation model.  
Further work can easily improve the evaluation of high task load onset by modeling its rise and fall. The final experiment shows that the effect was present even during the day in a car. The paper introduces the pupil dilation model at a time when cameras and evaluation of pupils allow this new method to be used broadly.


%The real time factor becomes particularly important for dialog systems and other mixed-initiative interfaces.
